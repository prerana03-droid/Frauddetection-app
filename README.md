# Frauddetection-app
Identify fraud transactions

In this project I have built a powerful fraud detection system using machine learning. This is a typical example of a full Python data science project! Starting from data gathering, processing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, prediction, cross-validation with an impressive 94% accuracy, deployment into Streamlit, dockerization , github and hosting a scalable streamlit app. I covered all dimensions expected to be covered by a "Machine Learning Engineer". The link to the app is mentioned below:

App link: https://frauddetection-app-9sxep2kis7eo9lgkdduf6q.streamlit.app/

Github link: https://github.com/prerana03-droid/Frauddetection-app/

This app can be used by banks to detect fraudulent transaction requests from customers and mitigate risk. This app can be plugged into the software of bank executives who will enter the transaction amount, last and new balances of sender and reciever whevever a new transaction request comes up. The app uses the backend classification model which identifies whether the transaction is "Fraudulent" or "Legit". The model has been trained on past transactions data. It is monitored at regular frequency (Quarterly/Half yearly). Versions can be mainted via Git actions and models are updated via CI/CD pipelines.

I used popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. Please view and share feedbacks. Whether you're a beginner or experienced data scientist, this project will enhance your skills and provide valuable insights into creating real-world scalable applications of machine learning.

Try the below transactions on the APP:

Type	    amount	   oldbalanceOrg	newbalanceOrig	oldbalanceDest	newbalanceDest

TRANSFER	2,35,512 	     2,35,512          0 	           0 	            0  

CASH OUT	5,01,719 	     2,68,288 	       0 	           0  	          27,79,773
